# Overview 
This project helps in visualizing pathfinding algorihtms like Astar, BFS, DFS, etc. This project is made using React and you can view the web page in dark as well as light mode. As you can see below there is a grid made using html table and the legend at the top shows what color represents which type of node it is.

# Algorithms 
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm 
- Dijkstra's Algorithm is weighted and guarantees the shortest path.
- It is the best algorithm for finding the shortest path paths with multiple destinations.
2. A* Algorithm 
- A* Search is weighted and guarantees the shortest path.
- It is a modification of Dijkstra's Algorithm and uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm.
3. Greedy Best First Search 
- Greedy Best-first Search is weighted and does not guarantee the shortest path.
- It selects the path which appears best at that moment. 
4. BFS 
- Breath-first Search is unweighted and guarantees the shortest path.
- Breadth First Search explores equally in all directions and is used to identify nearby places of interest in GPS.
5. DFS
- Depth-first Search is unweighted and does not guarantee the shortest path
- It traverses by exploring as far as possible down each path before backtracking and is a bad pathfinding algorithm
# Mazes
You can select any of these mazes from the dropdown list.
1. Recursive Division Maze
2. Spiral Maze
3. Random Maze
4. Stairs
# Getting Started :
First install node.js which comes with a bundle(npm+npx) to run javascript in local system.
Then open the folder containing the project and type the following commands: 

```
cd app
npm start
```

### npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

HURRAY ! Now you can see various pathfinding algorithms in action !
